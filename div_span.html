    <!--div is Divison Block tag-->
    <p><div>The div tag in HTML is a container that is used to group other HTML elements
        together and apply styles to them as a unit. It doesn't have any semantic meaning
        and is used purely for layout purposes.</div><div>When you want to group a set of elements 
        together, you can simply wrap them in a div tag.</div></p>
    <!--span is Inline Divison tag-->
    <p><span>The HTML element is a generic inline container for phrasing content, which does not inherently
        represent anything. It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the class or 
        id attributes),</span><span>or because they share attribute values, such as lang. It should be used only 
        when no other semantic element is appropriate. is very much like a element, but is a block-level 
        element whereas a is an inline-level element.</span></p>
